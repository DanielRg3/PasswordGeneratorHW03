# HomeWork#3: Password Generator

## Project Description:
In this project, a password had to be generated according to the following user's input:
- Length of characters
    - Being 8 the minimum amount
    - 128 the maximum amount
- Weather the user wanted to use lowercases characters.
- Weather the user wanted to use uppercases characters.
- Weather the user wanted to use numbers.
- Weather the user wanted to use symbol characters.

In this case **at least one type of character must be selected** if not an alert is displayed

## What I Learned:
In this project I learned how to link the JS into an HTML to include eventlisteners such as clicks for the Generate Password button.

Also, I learned about the HTML iput type=checkbox to create a checkbox that is checked by the user.

Math.floor & Math.Random were also used to genereate the password.

Finally, from a YT vedio I got the idea to include a slider to select the password length.
This was a jackput because it reduced the amout of validators to be used if I had leaved the question open for the user to write down how many charaters his/her password would have.

## Credits:
The idea to leave the type of charactes as questions in the main page, rather than window prompts was from a classmate. This helped me to moved forward because I was stucked at the window prompts, how to assing the users input into variables, and all validators to avoid user writing whatever they wanted.

Also, I studied and replicated a Password generator from <cite>Web Dev Simplified</cite>

Finally, I got a lot of help from my Tutors:
